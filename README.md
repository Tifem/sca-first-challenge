# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


//What the project does
The To-Do List is a simple application designed to help users keep track of tasks. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks as well as mark tasks as complete.

//challenges faced
State Management: Initially, managing the state of the task list was challenging.

//lesson learnt
React Hooks: I gained a deeper understanding of React hooks like useState and useEffect for managing and updating tasks efficiently.
